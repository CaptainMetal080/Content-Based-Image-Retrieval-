# Content-Based-Image-Retrieval-


This program is an Image Retrieval program

The purpose of the program is to find the closest match to an image the user chooses, the way we do it is as follows:

    1. First all the numbers are gathered from a library, each digit has 10 variations and they are all scanned handwritten images
    2. Each of these images are rendered into an array of grey scale values using the pygame library to scan the images
    3. using the arrays gathered from all the images we will make a barcode that coresponds to a digit and a variation.
    4. then after the barcodes are created, the user is prompted to choose what number and variation they are looking for
    5. then the barcode of the chosen image and the others will be compared and the program will find the closest image to the chosen one.
